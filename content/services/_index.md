The SciLifeLab Data Platform includes an environment for hosting web-based tools and databases related to data-driven life science that require large-scale compute and storage resources. The hosting environment is [maintained by the SciLifeLab Data Centre](/about/). See this page for the [technical set-up of the environment and our vision for it](./hosting/); researchers, research communities, and organisations in Sweden are welcome to apply for a tool/database to be hosted on the platform.
